      <p>I probably will keep statistics of your page visits on this site, but I&rsquo;m not going to take and record the codes that you try to minify. Some data such as the checked state on every check-box and radio elements in the form are stored via the local storage feature on your device.</p>
      <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p><b>Do you have any tool to minify PHP code?</b></p>
      <p>PHP code works on the server side so your clients will never download any PHP code from your server. Only the compiled results will be sent to the client. Minifying PHP code will not improve the performance of your site in any way.</p>
      <p><b>I want to minify my PHP code so that I can save my web hosting space.</b></p>
      <p>Okay, I will make it for you next time.</p>
      <p><b>Do you have any plan to use Bootstrap or Material Design framework to decorate this site?</b></p>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p><b>Your site has a terrible design.</b></p>
      <p>Thank you.</p>
